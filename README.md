Title:Context Conditional Generative Adversarial Network

Context:
Recently, less attention has been paid to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for unsupervised learning. As a result, i introduce the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) class of CNNs. The goal is to become familiar with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and use the GAN architecture to produce the handwritten digit digitally using data that is readily available. In my new framework, i simultaneously train two models—a discriminative model (D) that assesses the
probability that a sample originated from the training data as opposed to G and a generative model (G) that represents the data distribution—in an adversarial process. G's training program aims to increase the likelihood that D will commit a mistake. I have created a context-conditional generative adversarial network with a backpropagation mechanism that will assist CCGAN in locating the loss and updating the mechanism to overcome the loss during the generation of different images, allowing it to improve its performance. The maximum accuracy that we have achieved is around 93 percent.
